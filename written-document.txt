Client-server message format
The client is prompted to send an addition equation or subtraction equation to the server. Their input is checked to make sure it isn't empty and contains the numbers and signs necessary. Then, the server receives the message, and conducts the operations, then returns the answers to the client, while showing some of the process in the server.

The Client->Server Message Format and Server->Client Message Format can be seen in command-line-trace-client and command-line-trace-server.

The example output is similar to that of the example in the readme:
Client Trade
client starting - connecting to server at IP 127.0.0.1 and port 65432

What (addition/subtraction) equation would you like solved? (Please enter your equation in the following format: +1:3:5 or -1:3:5. The order of the numbers matter.)   +1:3:5
message sent, waiting for reply
Received response: '1+3+5=9' from server -> [7 bytes]
